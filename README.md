# bug-rescue-tunnel

**Help bugs find their way out of your screen!**

Sometimes tiny bugs get inside monitors and look stuck. This little web tool makes a glowing light tunnel to guide them toward the edge of the screen so they can escape safely.

## How to Use It

🖱 **Move your mouse** to show where the bug is on your screen.  
📍 **Click** to show where the bug should go to get out.  
🔍 **Scroll** the mouse wheel to make the tunnel wider or narrower.  
🔲 **Press "F"** to make the screen go big (fullscreen mode).  
❓ **Press "H"** to show the help instructions again.

When you start, instructions will pop up for a few seconds to help you!

## What It Does

- Shows a glowing "tunnel of light" from the bug to the exit.
- The tunnel changes size when you scroll.
- Everything outside the tunnel is dark or scary to encourage bugs to follow the light.
